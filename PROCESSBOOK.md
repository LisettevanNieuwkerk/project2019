#Process book 
* 3/6
    * Finished proposal
    * Started with processing dataset into pandas dataframe

* 4/6
    * Finished design
    * Continued with processing data and started with worldmap. Countries need to be linked to a countrycode for the worldmap. Also the wineyears needs to be extracted from the title of the wine. Possible to do this in js but makes application already slow. Countrycode and wineyear need to be added to the dataframe in python.
