#Process book 
* 3/6
    * Finished proposal
    * Started with processing dataset into pandas dataframe

* 4/6
    * Finished design
    * Continued with processing data and started with worldmap. Countries need to be linked to a countrycode for the worldmap. Also the wineyears needs to be extracted from the title of the wine. Possible to do this in js but makes application already slow. Countrycode and wineyear need to be added to the dataframe in python.

* 5/6
    * Done with preprocessing data in Python, added year and code to dataframe. Made function to calculate average rating and define colours in map for country. 

* 6/6
    * Create timeline for datamap and adapt map to data.

* 7/6
    * Added scatterplot and connected to worldmap and timeline. 
    * Problem: amount of data in scatterplot
    * Feedback: do not plot seperate wines on scatterplot but groups and make it possible to zoom in on price.
