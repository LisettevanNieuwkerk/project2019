* 3/6
    * Finished proposal
    * Started with processing dataset into pandas dataframe

* 4/6
    * Finished design
    * Continued with processing data and started with worldmap. Countries need to be linked to a countrycode for the worldmap. Also the wineyears needs to be extracted from the title of the wine. Possible to do this in js but makes application already slow. Countrycode and wineyear need to be added to the dataframe in python.

* 5/6
    * Done with preprocessing data in Python, added year and code to dataframe. Made function to calculate average rating and define colours in map for country. 

* 6/6
    * Create timeline for datamap and adapt map to data.

* 7/6
    * Added scatterplot and connected to worldmap and timeline. 
    * Problem: amount of data in scatterplot
    * Feedback: do not plot seperate wines on scatterplot but groups and make it possible to zoom in on price.

* 11/6
    * Make groups for scatterplot and add zoom function for x-Axis

* 12/6
    * Feedback: also make zoom possible for Y-axis.
    * Adapt zoom function for scatterplot. Add pop up modal with list of wines when clicked on dot.

* 13/6
    * Started with piechart but not functional with amount of different variety of grapes. Created circular packing instead.

* 14/6
    * Cleaned code and connect circular packing with scatterplot, timeline and map.

* 17/6
    * Add function to scrape data from wikepedia in python for grape types (red or white).

* 18/6
    * Remove some wines wout of scraped data hen not clear which grape type the belong to.

* 19/6
    * Started working on design of whole dashboard with css.

* 20/6
    * Continue on overall design and css. Made improvements on updating scatterplot (with correct zoom).

* 21/6
    * Add legenda to worldmap and titles to all figures. 
    * Feedback: give circular packing colors. Create update function and not just remove and add the data.

* 24/6
    * Give color to scatterplot
    * Add drowdown menu for countries and add years underneath slider.
    * Cleaning code

* 25/6
    * Create update function for worldmap and scatterplot
    * Did not work out for circularpacking because of simulation formula. Choose to remove and add date everytime.
    * Cleaned up code

* 26/6
    * Cleaning code
    * Add last css
    * Add extra page of navigation bar.
