*  Code grouping an organization
    * Group code together by function or subject. 

* Comments
    * Use comments above every function that explains function shortly   
    * Use comments for every paragraph of code that is grouped together.
    * Sometimes add small comment inside the paragraph when code needs furter explication.
    
* Tabs or spaces   
    * Space under every paragraph of code that is grouped together.
    * Double spaces between functions
    * Tabs after functions and after first sentence of d3 code (for example: after first selectAll)

* Proper naming of variables and functions.
    * Name variables the same in every function
    * Create variable names that are descriptice to make it easy to recognize what they are meant for.

* Patterns to be used,
    * Create three different figures on the same way. First create basis, with title and legenda,  in function and later create content in other function.
